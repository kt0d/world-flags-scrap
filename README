This script will save pictures of characters that are availble on  world-flags.org, along with character descriptions that will be saved in JSON format.

It makes use of:
- requests, to retrieve pages and images
- BeatifulSoup (bs4), to parse HTML
- pathlib and shutil, to save files and images
- json, to save JSON
- unicodedata, to normalize unicode text.
